# Very short description of the package

This package provides laravel implementations for Paynet FPX services.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jagdish-j-p/fpx-payment
```

Then run the publish command to publish the config files and support controller

```bash
php artisan fpx:publish
```

This will generate the following files

- The config file with default setup for you to override `fpx.php`
- The controller that will receive payment response and any host-to-host events `Http/Controllers/FPX/Controller.php`
- The assets in public directory.
- The view file with default html for you to override `payment.blade.php`. Note do not change form action URL `fpx.payment.auth.request`.

## Setups

1. Add your redirect urls and your Seller and Exchange Id to the `.env` file.

```php
FPX_INDIRECT_URL=https://app.test/payments/fpx/callback
FPX_INDIRECT_PATH=payments/fpx/callback
FPX_DIRECT_URL=https://app.test/payments/fpx/direct-callback
FPX_DIRECT_PATH=payments/fpx/direct-callback

FPX_EXCHANGE_ID=
FPX_SELLER_ID=
```

2. You can skip this steps, if you have already generated CSR. Visit `fpx/csr/request` path in browser to generate CSR.
   
	 `http://app.test/fpx/csr/request`
   
	 Fill the form and click on `GENERATE`. On right side textarea will be generated with openSSL code.
   Download openSSL from `https://www.openssl.org/` if you don't have installed it.
   Run openssl code to generate CSR. Submit this CSR to FPX service provider to get the Exchange Certificates.

3. After generating your certificates add them to your app. By default, we look for the certificates inside the following directives. 
	 Create `fpx/uat` and `fpx/prod` directories in `storage/app/public` directory and paste your certificates there. You can find UAT certificate in `uat certificate/fpxuat_current.cur` rename it with your Exchange ID and place it in mentioned UAT directory.

```php
'certificates' => [
	'uat' => [
		'disk' => 'local', // S3 or Local. Don't put your certificate in public disk
		'dir' => '/public/fpx/uat',
	],
	'production' => [
		'disk' => 'local', // S3 or Local. Don't put your certificate in public disk
		'dir' => '/public/fpx/prod',
	]
],
```

You can override the defaults by updating the config file.

3. Run migration to add the banks and fpx_transactions table

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

1. First run the following command to seed the banks list.

```bash
php artisan fpx:banks
```

you should schedule the fpx:banks Artisan command to run daily:

```php
$schedule->command('fpx:banks')->daily();
```

2. Add one the `x-fpx-payment` component with the following attributes

```php
 <x-fpx-payment
		:reference-id="$invoice->id"
		:datetime="$invoice->created_at->format('Ymdhms')"
		:amount="$invoice->total"
		:customer-name="$company->name"
		:customer-email="$company->owner->email"
		:product-description="Salary Invoice"
		:class="css class name for styling button">
```

During testing, you can use the `test-mode` attribute to override the provided amount to 'MYR 1.00'

```php
 <x-fpx-payment
		:reference-id="$invoice->id"
		:datetime="$invoice->created_at->format('Ymdhms')"
		:amount="$invoice->total"
		:customer-name="$company->name"
		:customer-email="$company->owner->email"
		:product-description="Salary Invoice"
		:class="css class name for styling button"
		test-mode>
```

3. Handle the payment response in `Http/Controllers/FPX/Controller.php`

```php

	/**
	 * This will be called after the user approve the payment
	 * on the bank side
	 *
	 * @param Request $request
	 * @return Response
	 */
	public function callback(Request $request) {
		$response = $request->handle();

		// Update your order status
	}

	/**
	 * This will handle any direct call from FPX
	 *
	 * @param Request $request
	 * @return string
	 */
	public function webhook(Request $request) {
		$response = $request->handle();

		// Update your order status

		return 'OK';
	}
```

4. Check Status of all pending transactions using command

```bash
php artisan fpx:payment-status
```

5. Check Status of specific transaction using command pass comma saperated order reference ids.

```bash
php artisan fpx:payment-status reference_id1,reference_id2,reference_id3
```

6. Check transaction status and Bank list from Controller

```php

use JagdishJP/FpxPayment/Fpx;

/**
 * Returns status of transaction
 * 
 * @param string $reference_id reference order id
 * @return array
 */
$status = Fpx::getTransactionStatus($reference_id);


/**
 * returns collection of bank_id and name 
 * 
 * @param bool $getLatest (optional) pass true to get latest banks 
 * @return \Illuminate\Support\Collection
 */
$banks = Fpx::getBankList(true);

```
